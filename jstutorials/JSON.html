        This is a container and Here I am Not really doing anything but I am learning how to stringify objects to be sent by JSON and I am also learning backend.... Soon I will learn MongoDB and Node.js and Express.js and finally I shall learn React.js and start my actual Web development practice working on my skills since it is very important but then also college (Not really I don't really care that much) but then still the skills are very important to get a high placement job and then start my own shit and show everybody that I am capable and I've already taken a really big L but from now onwards I ain't gonna take no L's in my fucking miserable life... things need to go smoothly from here on. There ain't no excuses U motherfucker... U just gonna do it. There's nobody to compete with your ass but yourself... the motivation for u to go is not to repeat the L's u have taken till now... I FUCKING hate L's and theres no way I'm letting myself have any more L's in my fucking life... MOTIVATION MOTIVATION MOTIVATION!!!!!
